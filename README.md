# Corporacion Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting

Final Project for INFO 7390: Advances in Data Science and Architecture

## Authors
Emily Strong and Raksha Kaverappa

## About
This is a project to forecast grocery sales for Corporaci√≥n Favorita, an Ecuadorian grocery chain. The data comes from an active Kaggle competition which is why we have not posted it here.

## Live App
[https://groceryforecasting.herokuapp.com/](https://groceryforecasting.herokuapp.com/)

Note: Because we used Heroku to deploy our web app, we had to create a separate repository for the app code. We have copied the live code to the Part5-Copy folder, but you can see the separate repository here:
